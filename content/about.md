Hi! My name is **Thomas** or **Tom** for short.

I'm based in Australia, and currently work as a DevOps engineer touching Linux &
AWS.

Most of my work is solving interesting problems, mentoring others, and writing
scripts/automations so myself and others spend less time doing mundane things.

I've been programming since I was a kid writing
[Batch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file),
[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)/[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS),
and light [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP). The first "real"
language I learnt was [Pawn](https://www.compuphase.com/pawn/pawn.htm) which had
C-like syntax.

Now days I enjoy doing things in TypeScript, Python & Bash. I've been using Node
since Node 4 and enjoyed watching JavaScript/ECMAScript mature over time. 

I previously worked on [SteamLevels.com](https://steamlevels.com) as the main
developer before working full-time. Now days I try my best to
make sure it's running OK.

Most of my personal projects are on my [GitHub](https://github.com/itsjfx). I
try to put as much things there as possible.

In my personal time I also listen to music, watch lots of movies, go to the gym,
game, work on my dotfiles, or learn about new tech.

As for where `jfx` came from, I thought it looked *aesthetically pleasing* and
cool, so I used it one day and it's stuck ever since.

## This website

This website is written in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and is designed to be as
light as possible (with no JavaScript!). I'm still undecided on the site's
design, so I've gone with the most plain thing possible (maybe too plain!) and
I'll build it up.

The source code is [available here](https://github.com/itsjfx/jfx.ac).

If I don't have time to write a blog post but want people to know about
something, I've probably published a public note! See
[notes.jfx.ac](https://notes.jfx.ac) for my public notes.
