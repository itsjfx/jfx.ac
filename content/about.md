## whoami

Hi! My name is **Thomas** or **Tom** for short.

I'm based in Australia, and currently work as a DevOps engineer touching Linux &
AWS.

My job is mostly solving interesting problems, mentoring others, and writing
scripts/automations so myself and others spend less time doing mundane things.

I've been programming since I was a kid writing
[Batch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file), and websites in [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) & [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP).

The language I spent a lot of time learning was
[Pawn](https://www.compuphase.com/pawn/pawn.htm), which had C-like syntax,
before moving onto learning Python 2.

Now days I enjoy doing things in TypeScript, Python & Bash. I've been using Node
since Node 4 and enjoyed watching JavaScript/ECMAScript mature over time. 

I have a keen interest in reverse-engineering, and using this skill to make
things do things they're not supposed to do, or building wrappers around things
to make them nicer to interact with.

I previously worked on [SteamLevels.com](https://steamlevels.com) as the main
developer before working full-time. Now days I try my best to
make sure it's running OK.

Most of my personal projects are on my [GitHub](https://github.com/itsjfx). I
try to put as much things there as possible.

In my personal time I also listen to music, watch lots of movies, go to the gym,
game, work on my dotfiles, or learn about new tech.

As for where `jfx` came from, I thought it looked *aesthetically pleasing* and
cool, so I used it one day and it's stuck ever since.

## This website

This website is written in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and is designed to be as
light as possible (with minimal JavaScript!). I'm still undecided on the site's
design, so I've gone with the most plain thing possible (maybe too plain!) and
I'll build it up.

The source code is [available here](https://github.com/itsjfx/jfx.ac).

If I don't have time to write a blog post but want people to know about
something, I've probably published a public note! See
[notes.jfx.ac](https://notes.jfx.ac) for my public notes.
